# Dice-Roll-Game

# Description

Pig is a simple dice game first described in print by John Scarne in 1945
Players take turns to roll a single die as many times as they wish, adding all roll results to a running total, but losing their gained score for the turn if they roll a 1.
Each turn, a player repeatedly rolls a die until either a 1 is rolled or the player decides to "hold":

# Instructions How to play

- If the player rolls a 1, they score nothing and it becomes the next player's turn.

- If the player rolls any other number, it is added to their turn total and the player's turn continues.

- If a player chooses to "hold", their turn total is added to their score, and it becomes the next player's turn.

\*The first player to score 100 or more points wins.
